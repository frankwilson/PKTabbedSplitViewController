-- Bugs: --
[ ] iPad: When we have detail open but go to split-screen where it's hidden, should we open it as a modal?
          And close modal when switching from narrow split-screen to full-size or wide split-screen.

-- Resolved: --
[✓] iPhone: Opening of a modal detail view
[✓] iPad: Add opening of master view in portrait after tap on an tab bar item
[✓] iPad: When rotating to portrait mode, master view hiding is not animated
[✓] iPad: When going from narrow split-screen to wide split-screen, master view stays shown.
[✓] iPad: Detail screen Close button not working
